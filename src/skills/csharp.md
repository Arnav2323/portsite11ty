C# was the first programming language I learned during my college studies, where I developed a solid foundation in programming concepts through various projects and console applications. Initially, I engaged with C# for small-scale projects that allowed me to grasp the essential principles of coding and software development. As I became more proficient in C#, I expanded my skills by creating game trainers and modifications for popular games, such as F1 2021. This experience enabled me to customize the gameplay in career mode, enhancing my understanding of game mechanics and providing a practical application for my programming knowledge. Through these endeavors, I not only honed my technical abilities but also cultivated a passion for game development and software engineering.
