I began my journey with JavaScript during my first year at university and quickly recognized its potential as a powerful programming language. Over the years, it has become my primary language, allowing me to develop expertise in both front-end and back-end development. I have successfully completed several projects that highlight my skills, including a HIIT (high-intensity interval training) app designed to help users manage their workouts and a virtual pet app that offers an engaging interactive experience. These projects demonstrate my commitment to creating user-centric applications.
